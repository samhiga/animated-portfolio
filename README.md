## Usage 

The website is to be used to inquire for more information on me for potential employers to see if I would be a good fit for their company. They can view my bio, technologies, my work, and my contact information. The navigation bar at the top can direct them to what they are looking for. A contact form is there if someone wants to get in touch with me, as well as view my LinkedIn and Github accounts and even download my resume.

-------------------

## Learning Points
Through this project, I got more time working with react which is always a benefit and a better, more comprehensive experience working with and messing around with framer motion. I also discovered EmailJS and was surprisingly straightforward to use.
